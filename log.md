##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: December 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a web-app to manage students and courses in a university.

**Thoughts:** I'm using Flask and bootstrap for the first time. Getting the forms to not overlap was harder than I thought.

### Day 1: December 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the web-app to manage students and courses in a university. The app can now display students and courses (both all and one at a time). Also, now handling POST request to add new students and courses, but still using hard-coded data.

**Thoughts:** With flask-wtf encoding elements of a FieldList as seperate keys, parsing the request keys to create a list is messier than I like. I'm sure there's a better way to do this.


### Day 2-3: December 9-10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took a break and built an API to generate images of the mandelbrot set, and a webpage with embedded p5.js to display it.

**Thoughts:** The performance leaves a lot to be desired, but I learned a lot about how to glue python and javascript together, and that's all that matters.
